# Sales_Insight-dashboard

Created a PowerBI dashboard with the data stored in SQL database. The data consists of some organization which carries on business in 15 cities of India. 
Database consists of 5 tables which gives detailed information of orders and transactions.

PowerBI dashboard shows the various information about the top markets, top customers, revenue trend, etc. These information can be altered based on year and month.
In addition, mobile view of the dashboard is also created.

However, this is my first dashboard and I have tried my best to do it.
